Foundations of CFD Jan-May 23 offered by Dr. Arul Prakash. The course covers concepts of finite difference and finite volume schemes. That includes implicit and explicit schemes, iterative solvers like Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel, TDMA/Thomas Algorithm, PISO Algoirthm, SIMPLEX algorithm. The following two assignments cover the below mentioned topics.
- Assignment 2 is about solving steady state temperature problem using implicit/explicit, with/without relaxation schemes and perform a quantitative study of the time taken and the number of iterations.
- Assignment 3 is solving the benchmark lid driven cavity problem using the stream vorticity function approach.
